In modern technological landscapes, automation has become an essential element in enhancing efficiency and reliability across various sectors. My recent project, Timely Anthem: Automated National Anthem Playback System, exemplifies this principle by leveraging cutting-edge hardware components to automate a traditionally manual task—playing the National Anthem at specific times each day. This project integrates Arduino Mega, Relay Module, Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module, and I2C Display to ensure precise time-based control and automatic execution. With its ability to perform without human oversight, this system offers numerous advantages in settings where punctuality and consistency are paramount, such as educational institutions, government buildings, and public sector organizations.
The Arduino Mega serves as the central controller, coordinating all system operations. The RTC Module provides precise timekeeping, ensuring the anthem is played at exactly the right moment each day. The Relay Module controls the external speaker, turning it on when the scheduled time arrives, and the I2C Display provides live feedback of the current time and date, making it easy to monitor the system.

Key Features:

•Automation: The anthem is played automatically at a designated time each day.

•Accurate Timekeeping: The RTC module ensures precise, real-time time tracking.

•Remote Monitoring: The I2C display shows the current date and time for easy monitoring.

•Scalability & Reliability: Ideal for schools, government buildings, or public institutions that require consistent, scheduled anthem playback.

The system is powered by the Arduino Mega, which is programmed to compare the time from the RTC against a predefined playback schedule. When the set time is reached, the relay is triggered, activating the speaker. This project highlights my skills in embedded systems, automation, and integrating various components to create reliable, time-sensitive systems.!
